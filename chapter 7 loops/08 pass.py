#for this if i want run program it wiil written error here
#here we write only half of the program in for 
#then we shif to another program which is i = =& while wala 
#so we don't waana write our 1st for program compltely but here it will written erron
#after we run it it return error because in complte of for (1st program)
#so we use pass statement which will 
#which will not effect in program directly run second program without complitation of first program



#pass is null statement
