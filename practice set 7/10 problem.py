#first our table is like print
#sidha     #reverse
#1             10
#2              9
                 
#3              8
#4              7
#5               6
#6              5
#7              4
#8               3
#9                 2
#10              1

##if we observe the sum is 11
# so we take 11 - i for multiplication in reverse
#   
#so here what happen is 11- 1 = 10
# 11-2 = 9
# 
# 
# 
# 
# so onup to 11-10 =1
