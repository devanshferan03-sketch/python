#tuples are immutable like strings

a =  (1,2,3) #(1,2,3) aew tuple in below we write type the 
#o/p of this is be tuple 
#how it identify that it is tuple it is because 1,2,3 are in bracket ant we use coma
#a =(1,) # here o/p is type tuple but for that we mut use , after 1 so python identify that it is tuple not an interger
print(type(a))
a = (1,45,342,False,"Rohan")
print(type(a))
